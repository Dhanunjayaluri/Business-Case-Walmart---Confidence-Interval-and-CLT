# Business-Case-Walmart---Confidence-Interval-and-CLT

## Business Problem

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
## Dataset

You can access the dataset [here](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/001/293/original/walmart_data.csv?1641285094). Also you can find the csv file in the repo. 


The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:

-'User_ID' :	User ID
-'Product_ID':	Product ID
-'Gender':	Sex of User
-'Age':	Age in bins
-'Occupation':	Occupation(Masked)
-'City_Category':	Category of the City (A,B,C)
-'StayInCurrentCityYears':	Number of years stay in current city
-'Marital_Status':	Marital Status
-'ProductCategory':	Product Category (Masked)
-'Purchase':	Purchase Amount

## Project Goals

Our exploration will aim to address the following questions:

- Defining Problem Statement and Analyzing basic metrics.
- For continuous variable(s): Distplot, countplot, histogram for univariate analysis
-For categorical variable(s): Boxplot
-For correlation: Heatmaps, Pairplots
-Business Insights based on Non- Graphical and Visual Analysis.
-Are women spending more money per transaction than men? Why or Why not?
-Confidence intervals and distribution of the mean of the expenses by female and male customers.
-Are confidence intervals of average male and female spending overlapping? How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
-Results when the same activity is performed for Married vs Unmarried
-Results when the same activity is performed for Age.
- Illustrate the insights based on exploration and CLT

## Data Exploration and Visualization

The project will involve data analysis, visualization by  Confidence Interval and CLT to analyze customer purchase behavior, specifically purchase amount, against customer gender and other factors to help Walmart make better decisions.
